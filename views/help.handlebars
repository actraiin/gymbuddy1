  <h6> Welcome to Gym Buddy! Your one stop destination for expanding your social network, but getting healthier at the same time. Our goal is to create a easy to use system that allows our users to find new workout partners and make new friends at the same time. All you have to do is create an account through our simple registration form and let us know a little bit more about yourself.

Based off of the data you enter here, we'll find you a workout partner that best matches your skill level.</h6>
